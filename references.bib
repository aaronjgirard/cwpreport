The authors perform motion magnification using a complex steerable pyramid, which involves filtering the video along various directions to better characterize motion.  Their method is computationally expensive compared to other methods, but is potentially more accurate and robust in the presence of noise and in the absence of image texture.  The authors deduce sound from vibration objects using high speed video, which is precisely the goal of my current project.  Successful applications for a variety of experiments show that motion magnification can work, with varying degrees of success, on a variety of materials.  The authors show that when light rigid objects are filmed, the resulting audio recovered from video is more accurate than when heavy objects are filmed.  Ideally, the high speed videos from this study will be used in my project to compare linear Eulerian versus phase-based motion magnification.},
